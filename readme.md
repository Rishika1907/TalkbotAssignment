# Talk-Bot
A simple talkbot developed in python using speech recognition,pyttsx, and chatterbot packages. In this program, the speech input is converted into text (with the help of a speech recognition package), the text received is processed by the chatterbot, and the response from the chatterbot is converted into audio with the help of the pyttsx package.
